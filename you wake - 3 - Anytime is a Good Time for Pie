Chapter 3: Anytime is a Good Time for Pie

Measure and Charity were playing with blocks in the parlour. Verity was a untidy heap lying on the sofa. There is a stones game set

Measure rushes up to you and pulls your leg. “Bear, Bear,” he says, pointing at his blocks. You smile hearing him call you by Comfort’s nickname for you. You look at Comfort but she is looking at Verity. You can see the bounce and enthusiasm drain out of Comfort. Her somber mood feels wrong. You never see her with a serious expression.

“Comfort, look Measure has made a tower,” you say, couching down, your voice full of awe and astonishment. Your antics raise a half smile from Comfort and divert her attention from Verity.

“You made a tower?” says Comfort sitting on the ground, “Is it a big tower?”

“Ower!” says Measure pointing at the blocks. 

“You’re such a good boy.” Comfort hugs her son, a tear running down her face.

“Boots!” says Measure point to his Mother’s shoes. He rushes off. He returns with two slippers.

“Thank you, precious,” says Comfort, pulling off her shoes and putting on the slippers.

Measure reappears and pushes a second pair of slippers at you. “Ippas,” he insists.

“Yes, we are supposed to wear slippers in the parlour,” agrees Comfort, smiling, her mood lifting. 

“Ride!” demands Charity lifting up her arms. You hoist her up and twirl her around. You would pull her on your shoulders but the ceiling is just too low.

“Me!” cries Measure, not to be outdone. You swat and pick him up with the other arm, they both laugh as you spin them around. 

“I have just quieten them down and now you’re getting them excited,” complains Verity. She looks terrible. Your heartbeat surges as you notice the yellow tint to the whites of her eyes, the rash covering a third of her face. You put the children down and step closer.

Comfort grabs your hand. “Not a good idea,” she warns. 

“I just want to check her gums,” you explain. 

“They are receding and their is a dark line at their base. I checked this morning,” Comfort says.

“I’m dying. I need blood,” says Verity.

“Thats not happening,” states Comfort firmly.

“I need blood,” repeats Verity, will more emphasis.

“After last time? You’ll drink spit and like it,” says Comfort. “If you drank more from the blue flask you wouldn’t be in this position.”

“Spit isn’t enough anymore. I need blood,” argues Verity. Charity hugs your leg. Measure pulls Charity’s hand, trying to pull her out of the danger area. Both of them seem very aware of the hostility in the air.

“Blood, blood, blood. That’s all you can talk about. After what you did you are lucky I don’t - “ Comfort spits out, her hands hovering near her sleeves.

“You’re going to help me join my One and only?” asks Verity. “I should never have listened to you and Nimble. I should have stayed true to my husband. Now Charity has no father.”

“He doesn’t deserve to be called her father. He broke her fingers,” accuses Comfort.

“That was an accident,” says Verity, looking away.

“How many other ‘accidents’ have here been, Verity?” ask Comfort. “How many?”

“You didn’t have to kill him,” says Verity.

“He beat you very Market day, after he had a few beers. We all saw the bruises.” insisted Comfort. “And he tried to choke me.”

“And Level is the only one that is allowed to hit you, is that right? Him and your father,” spits out Verity.

Comforts hands drive into her sleeves. You step in between them, hampered by Charity’s hold on your leg, ready to intervene. Comfort hands re-emerge from her sleeves, they are empty. She stomps over to the low table and pours a drink from a blue pitcher. She adds something from a capped mug that she retrieves from her pouch. 

“Drink this,” she orders.

“It smells of him,” Verity protests. “You smell of him. And you haven’t put your corset back on right. Do you think so little of your vows?”

“I never wanted Level,” says Comfort coldly. “They gave me to him because he was tall, and a wife shouldn’t be taller than her husband. The same reason they gave Hush to Fort.”

“You can make all the excuses you want, that doesn’t change what you are,” says Verity her voice full of venom.

“Drink up, unless you want Charity to be an orphan,” says Comfort her voice flat and unyielding.

Verity lifts the cup toward her mouth, her expression conflicted. “I won’t be his woman,” she says.

“Fort is light-blessed. If the shining ones approve of him, who are you to look down at him?” Comfort shouts. “Besides what makes you think he would lower himself to be with you?”

You look at the children. They are far too quiet. Charity clutches your leg as if her life depended on it. Measure pulls at her shoulder trying to warn her, “Hm, Hm,” he says, barely audible.

“You are scaring the children,” you warn. Comfort has the grace to look ashamed. Verity’s expression barely flickers. She brings the cup to her lips. Ecstasy overwhelms her as she greedily gulps it down. 

“Want some more?” asks Comfort. Verity doesn’t say anything. Her face is haunted by a heart broken expression. Comfort refills her cup anyway. 

You pick up the children and carry them to the sofa on the far side of the room. Comfort joins you. She lifts up tunic and lets Measure suckle. Charity buries herself in your shoulder. You stay like that for a while. After a while Charity wiggles out of your arm and returns to playing with the blocks. A little while latter Measure joins her.

Nimble enters the room. “Who died?” she asks. No-one answers.

“What’s happening?” you ask.

“They found that girl. No-one is admitting anything, but the way they are acting I am sure she is a posey. The girl is staying with them for the moment. They have agreed in principle to an alliance between our two group with Reliance acting as a liaison, with the details to be nutted out later. Parry has agreed to train Temperance in swordplay, and the way she keeps waving that Leafblade around we are all going to be grateful for that. Light says she is not confident in disabling all her fathers traps and I am not convinced that the risks of an adventure outside the city are worth it. So thats on hold. Temperance has agreed to let them use her place so they will be moving next door. With the increased opportunity for mutual support thats going to improve both our security. Temperance and Reliance are looking after the shop so I finally have some time to breathe,” Nimble expounds without pausing for breath. “Do you want to finish our game?” she asks gesturing the stones game.

You sit down opposite her. Comfort moves closer to watch. Verity seems to be asleep.

You are losing. The game seems to be similar to what is called spears on Prime. You slide four stones forward capturing two of her stones. It is an aggressive and confident move. Nimble raises her eyebrows. You know it is a risk acting so differently to Fort, but if you want some control of the situation you need to win their respect. Within 10 minutes you capture a square on her baseline and she is unable to respond. She sets up another game and is about to remove some of her stones when you stop her. Instead you remove four of your stones.

“After just one win you are getting so cocky?” comments Nimble. “Don’t get overconfident.”

“I’m not,” you insist.

After 20 minutes you capture her baseline again. You give her a 5 stone advantage in the next game and win again. She finally wins when you give her a six stone advantage. Nimble stares at you for a while. “I understand,” she says. “You are like Comfort. You pretend to be someone you’re not. You pretend to harmless, because people take one look at you and are automatically frightened. That’s why you pretend to be a dumb amiable lunk. People know that they can never match you physically, so you let them believe they outmatch out mentally, that way they can feel superior and it causes less problems.”

You don’t contradict Nimble, besides what she saying is mostly true. Fort has been deliberately putting out a goofy ’I am harmless’ vibe from time he started growing so much faster than other children.

“Thank you, for finally trusting us enough to show who you really are,” says Nimble.

You glance at Comfort. Her mouth is open. She is staring at you with total shock. You return your attention to Nimble. You always knew that she was smart, but you now realise she is really, really smart. She may actually be as smart as you.

“Your welcome,” you say.

“Comfort it’s your turn to cook. Why don’t you start preparing dinner?” asks Nimble.

“Yes,” she says uncertainly. With a final backward look at you, she disappears into the kitchen.

“Would you like to learn a different game?” you ask. You know thousands of games from hundreds of different worlds.

“Yes, I would,” says Nimble.

“In this one one instead of stones going in the squares they go at the intersection of the lines. Instead of moving the stones, you place them on the board one by one,” you explain. After you finish explaining the rules, you play a game. You notice Charity and Measure have both fallen asleep when you weren’t paying attention. You cover them with a blanket. Verity raises her head briefly then closes her eyes again. You continue playing with Nimble until the children wake up. You translate some of the children’s songs you know into their language adjusting them to match the meter and rhyming scheme. The afternoon goes quickly and you are all soon seated around the dinner table. Verity has insisted she is not hunger and has retired to her room. Temperance helping the children feed themselves at a low table. 

“Do you think Verity is going to make it?” asks Comfort.

“Sometime I worry about what will happen if she does make it,” says Nimble. “I was wrong about her. I should never have invited her to join the group. I thought that all she needed was a little push, but I pushed too hard. She wasn’t ready and now I’ve put everyone’s lives in danger. We can’t let her go. She knows to many of our secrets.”

“If you didn’t invite her she and Charity would be dead,” says Comfort. “It’s my fault. I should never have killed One.”

“If you hadn’t have acted he would have taken both Verity and Charity. You would have been beaten, possibly killed.”

“I could have just wounded him.”

“If you didn’t take him out straight away he would have killed you.”

“I should have just let Fort stop him.”

“If he used you as a hostage what could Fort have done? Fort’s strong but he is not fast enough to have prevented One snapping your neck.” 

“Rehashing old decisions is not going to help,” you say.

“She hurt you. We can’t allow that to happen again,” says Nimble.

“She won’t do that again,” says Comfort.

“Is that your guilt talking?” says Nimble.
