Chapter 2: Bakers Dozen.

There was a click as the back door opened “Ew! Maker’s Mercy.” exclaimed Reliance. “Would you take it upstairs.”

“Did you catch someone in the act?” says someone behind Reliance. “Who is it?”

“Never you mind,” huffed Reliance quickly closing the door on her curious friend.

“There’s never a quiet moment around here,” complained Comfort. “Is that Joy Smith in the back room? You know that you’re  not supposed to let people in to the private areas of the bakery.”

“It’s Grace - I think,” says Reliance. “It doesn’t matter. Who do you think you are telling me what to do? You’re not my mother, you’re not my sister-in-law, you’re just the Destroyer Cursed next door neighbour. Hush isn’t dead a three week and your screwing her husband on their table.”

“From what Nimble says she wouldn’t mind,” says Comfort. With great reluctance Comfort disentangled herself from you and let herself down until she was standing on the floor. You roll down your tunic, covering yourself.

“Nimble isn’t his husband either,” says Reliance. 

“Arguing and making a fuss isn’t going to bring Hush back,” you say.

“You’re glad she’s dead aren’t you,” accuses Reliance. 

You feel a surge of shame and guilt. “Of course not. I would have saved her if I could,” you say.

“You let Nimble, Comfort and the others barge in here and change everything,” says Reliance.

“Things are different now. We need to band together for protection,” you say.

“Yes, I can see what kind of protection Comfort has been giving you,” retorts Reliance. “What in the Destroyer’s dungeons are you doing?” she asks Comfort.

You see Comfort with something white and sticky on hands wiping it into a cup. 

“I’m saving a peace offering for Nimble. It’s a lot than better than spit but not as good as blo- uhm, not as good as other things,” says Comfort. She is licking her fingers with relish.

“That’s disgusting,” says Reliance turning away.

“Not so much. Everything to do with a posey smells and tastes wonderful,” says Comfort. “You could smell him the minute you walked in the door, couldn’t you? Doesn’t it make you want to bury your nose in his hair? To lick him all over? To bite him?”

Reliance is flushed and breathing heavier. She marches over to the water jugs and takes a drink from the blue pitcher. “No I don’t,” she mutters. “I’m fine with spit.” She stare off in the distance not meeting your glaze. “That’s all my brother is to you and your friends isn’t it. A great big heard beast that you can milk for posey juice.”

“Fort is just a big cuddly bear you can’t help but love, sweetness," says Comfort.

You groan inwardly. When Comfort calls someone sweetness it was never a good sign. 
 
“Oh, give me a break. You looked down your nose at Hush and Fort because they were only Bakers and your husband is a cabinet maker,” says Reliance.

“Well I’m not with Level now, and it was by my own choice,” says Comfort quietly. 

“Because Fort is a posey and can keep you safe from the plague,” says Reliance. 

“I could have brought Level, Fort would have agreed, but I didn’t,” says Comfort. 

“And you’re faithlessness is purposed to endear you to me,” says Reliance.

“Nimble vouches for Comfort and she has been respectful since she has been here,” you say.

“I can see how respectful she has been,” says Reliance.

"Enough!" You say. “The apprentices are dead, as are the sales girls. Plus now we need to protect ourselves. The few Duke's guards that are still alive are more interested in stealing everything that isn't cemented down than keeping the peace.”


“We don’t have enough people to both defend the bakery and send out people to get supplies. We need more people. Especially fighters and a healer if we can get one. 
Why don’t we recruit Hawkeye’s boys?”

“No men. Both Nimble and I agreed on no men,” says Comfort. “Men are nothing but trouble.”

“And women aren’t trouble?” you ask. “What of me? I am a man. Are you going to toss me out of my own bakery?”

“You are an acceptable compromise,” says Comfort.

“Acceptable compromise?” you protest. If this was the old Comfort you would be sure that was an insult, with this new semi-reformed Comfort you are uncertain.

“As much as I hate to agree with the naked pervert, she’s right,” admitted Reliance.

“That I am an acceptable compromise?” you ask.

“No, that boy’s are nothing but trouble. No offence, Fort,” clarified Reliance.

“Why would I be offended,” you say, gritting your teeth.

“I would even put up with Thimble and Cushion rather than deal with Cut and Thrust Guard. What about Parry? She can handle a sword just as well as her brothers,” says Reliance.

“Why thank you, Noncompliance,” retorted Comfort.

“You’re welcome Culvert.”

“Likewise Connivence.”

“Will you two stop insulting each other like 5 year olds?” you ask.
